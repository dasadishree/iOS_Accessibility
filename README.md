# iOS_Accessibility
***Empowering developers to easily build inclusive iOS apps***

Apple has many accesibility features including VoiceOver, AssistiveTouch, ColorFilters, and more! 
However, most developers don't take advantage of these features in their apps. 

This research is to promote and grow the userbase for Apple's accessibility features and grow developer awareness of accessibility tools through creating ethical writeups, instructional videos, etc.

Eventually, I will develop an app that showcases my research and teaches developers about various ways to implement accessibility features into their apps.
