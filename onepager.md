### Project Objective
To examine how Apple incorporates accessibility into iOS and how developers can build inclusive technology by incorporating similar tools, aiming to promote accessible design through educational content and resources targeted for developers.  

### Background: Why Does Accessibility Matter?
Inclusive design is important to ensure that technology is able to be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities. Apple has many built-in accessibility features like VoiceOver, AssistiveTouch, and others. However, most apps don’t take advantage of these features. By researching Apple’s framework and accessibility features, we can promote better practices and get developers to implement features that make technology accessible to anyone.

### Key Findings
1. **Apple iOS Accessibility Framework**: Apple provides many developer tools that allow apps to be accessible with minimal code changes. These tools can assist people who have various disabilities impairing their vision, speech, mobility, cognition, or hearing. 
    a. Some tools include VoiceOver, Music Haptics, Switch Control, Guided Access, Text to Speech, closed captions, audio descriptions, etc.
    b. Besides these tools, Apple also provides documentation for developers to learn how to support and include those with disabilities and develop technologies that can make it possible for everyone to enjoy an app.
2. **Lack of Awareness Among Developers**: Not only do a lot of developers not know about the tools available to them, many don’t prioritize accessibility because they believe that it is not important enough to focus on due to low demand or a low population of people who will actually use the features. Furthermore, many developers also believe adding accessibility features is too time-consuming and complex.
    a. To combat this, we can show developers statistics of people who would use their app if it were inclusive to them. 1 in 4 disabled people had trouble accessing apps in a 2020 study, which would include millions of people.  
    b. By providing visual graphics and posts, as well as Apple’s documentation, developers can be guided to add accessibility features to reduce complexity.
    c. Accessibility features don’t have to be drastic. Small changes like captions, contrast in color, or labels can significantly improve usability for disabled users with minimal development, time, and effort needed on the developers’ end. 
    d. In conclusion, it is important for the developer to be educated and aware about accessibility features to be able to implement them. 

### Implications & Next Steps
* **Accessibility isn’t just ethical, it’s also practical**: Accessible apps are not only more usable for people with impaired abilities, but they are also more usable for all users and have a better quality.
* **Raising developer awareness is very important**: Developers must take advantage of Apple’s accessibility features in their apps to improve usability and quality.
* **Infographic Series**: Design infographics and checklists to share online in developer communities, social media, and on Linkedin to visually guide developers on steps to make their apps more accessible. 

#### Further Research:
Measure how accessibility improvements affect user data like engagement and satisfaction both for users with and without impairments
How can AI be used in the context of accessibility or to assist developers?
